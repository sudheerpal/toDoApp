# toDoApp
Its a basic functioning to do app, where we can add new task, edit existing task and can also delete task upon completion.

Filter (search) task and clear list are extra added feature.

## Instal NPM module
npm i     to add all dpenedencies.

Incase of local environment has ng version incompatibility, then npm start will run the application.
